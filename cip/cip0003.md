# CIP-0003: Enhanced Encryption Support

## Summary

Improve the implementation and documentation of encrypted archive functionality in the finx package, focusing on the password protection features using PyZipper.

## Motivation

Currently, PyZipper is included as an optional dependency but there are several areas for improvement:

1. Users may not be aware that password protection is available
2. The setup process for encryption features is not well documented
3. Error handling and validation for encrypted archives could be enhanced
4. There's no easy way to verify if a zip is properly encrypted
5. Integration tests with actual encryption/decryption are minimal

## Detailed Description

This CIP proposes to enhance the encryption features by:

1. Improving user-facing documentation for encryption features
2. Adding command-line options to explicitly enable/disable encryption
3. Adding verification features for encrypted archives
4. Improving error handling for encryption-related operations
5. Adding comprehensive integration tests for the encryption functionality
6. Adding clear documentation for how to install with encryption support

## Implementation Plan

The implementation will follow these steps:

1. *Documentation Updates*:
   - Update README.md with encryption setup instructions
   - Update CLI help text to document encryption options
   - Create a dedicated encryption.md document

2. *Code Improvements*:
   - Add explicit encryption options to CLI commands
   - Add validation functions for encrypted archives
   - Refactor error handling for encryption-related issues
   - Add warning system for when PyZipper is requested but not available

3. *Testing Enhancements*:
   - Add integration tests that verify encryption works end-to-end
   - Add verification tests for encrypted archives
   - Add tests for CLI encryption options

## Backward Compatibility

These changes will be backward compatible. Existing functionality will remain unchanged, with new features being added incrementally.

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for new validation functions
- Integration tests for actual encryption/decryption
- End-to-end tests for CLI encryption options
- CI checks to verify functionality with and without PyZipper installed

## Implementation Status

- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] CLI encryption options
- [ ] Validation functions
- [ ] Error handling improvements
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] CI script improvements

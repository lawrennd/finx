# Task: Add Encryption Integration Tests

- **ID**: 2025-05-05_encryption-integration-tests
- **Title**: Create integration tests for encryption functionality
- **Status**: Proposed
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Created**: 2025-05-05
- **Last Updated**: 2025-05-05
- **Owner**: Unassigned
- **GitHub Issue**: N/A
- **Dependencies**: pyzipper library

## Description

While there are basic unit tests for the encryption functionality, there's a need for more comprehensive integration tests that verify the end-to-end functionality of encrypted archives. This task involves:

1. Creating integration tests that actually create encrypted archives
2. Testing decryption of those archives to verify content integrity
3. Verifying that encryption fails gracefully when pyzipper is not available
4. Testing the new CLI encryption options across different scenarios
5. Adding tests for archive encryption verification

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create end-to-end tests for encryption/decryption cycle
- [ ] Add tests that verify archive content integrity after encryption
- [ ] Add tests for graceful fallback when pyzipper is unavailable
- [ ] Create tests for all new CLI encryption options
- [ ] Add tests for archive encryption verification
- [ ] Configure CI to run tests with and without pyzipper installed

## Implementation Notes

The implementation should:
- Use pytest fixtures to manage test archives and cleanup
- Use temporary directories to avoid leaving test files
- Mock user input for password entry where needed
- Create parameterized tests to cover various encryption scenarios
- Add a test matrix in CI that tests with and without pyzipper
